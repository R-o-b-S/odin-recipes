    <p> This is Tapi's secret recipe for artichokes. "Who's Tapi?" you ask.<br>
        Well, that's a secret just like this recipe. Sharing it I'm putting my own safety on the line.
    </p>

    <p>Let's start with ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>artichokes</li>
        <li>white wine</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now that you got all the necessary let's cook!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>clean your artichokes. We only need it's delicious and soft heart</li>
        <li>cut artichokes hearts in half</li>
        <li>finely cut parsley</li>
        <li>spill some olive oil in your pan, add one clove of garlic and turn on heating</li>
        <li>when oil is ready add artichokes and salt them directly in the pan</li>
        <li>stir and then apply the pan lid for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>blend with wine</li>
        <li>add parsley and pepper, then stir</li>
        <li>pour little water and leave it cooking 10 more minutes. This time no lid</li>
        <li>enjoy</li>
    </ol>
    <p><i>Optional: use ground chili pepper instead of pepper</i></p>

    <p>Now that the recipe is done and you know Tapi's secret I go into hiding fearing the day an hitsquad made of cooks
        will come for me.</p>
