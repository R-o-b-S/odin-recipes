        Carbonara, a name that echoes through every dining all in Italian resturants.<br>
        The story of this simple and tastefull dish is heavely debated so we are not going to delve in it.<br>
        What matters the most to us now is the only important thing. <b>It is delicious.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>At least following the original recipe.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Many degenerates contaminate this sacred dish using nefarious ingredients like Panna (cooking cream).<br>
        <i>yhea, I'm talking to you northen Italians.</i><br>
        In cooking is nice to experiment new things and try variations but if you really want to touch pasta Nirvana
        stick with me this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following recipe is the traditional one. Lets start with ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Guanciale (better) or Bacon</li>
        <li>Pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>coarse salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that you have all the necessary lets cook!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with water and put it to boil</li>
        <li>While water is boiling:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Cut guanciale in little pieces</li>
                <li>Break eggs separating yolk, we only need that</li>
                <li>Mix yolk with a lot of Pecorino cheese and pepper. If using a differnt cheese then pecorino add salt
                    too</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When water is boiling add coarse salt and spaghetti</li>
        <li>Quickly put guanciale in a pan at high temperature for 2 minutes and then leave it fry at low temperature
        </li>
        <li>when spaghetti is <i>al dente</i> take them out of the pot and put them in the pan with guanciale</li>
        <li>Add little cooking water from spaghetti to the pan and stir all togheter until there is almost no water left
        </li>
        <li>Turn off the heating and quickly add yolk mixed beforehand</li>
        <li>Gently stir all togheter</li>
        <li>Put little extra Pecorino and Pepper on top</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Unless you are a cooking god Carbonara never goes well on the first attempt, or second, or third.<br>
        Despite beeing a simple dish with simple steps it is quite hard to balance taste and cremosity. Don't lose hope
        and keep trying.<br>
        <b><i>You will eventually taste food Nirvana</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>Good luck my young padawan</p>
